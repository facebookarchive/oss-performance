    # Default ini options for sessions.

    # Some distributions of Linux (most notably Debian) ship their PHP
    # installations with garbage collection (gc) disabled. Since Drupal depends
    # on PHP's garbage collection for clearing sessions, ensure that garbage
    # collection occurs by using the most common settings.

    # Set session lifetime (in seconds), i.e. the time from the user's last
    # visit to the active session may be deleted by the session garbage
    # collector. When a session is deleted, authenticated users are logged out,
    # and the contents of the user's $_SESSION variable is discarded.
    # @default 200000
    gc_maxlifetime: 200000
    #
    # Set session cookie lifetime (in seconds), i.e. the time from the session
    # is created to the cookie expires, i.e. when the browser is expected to
    # discard the cookie. The value 0 means "until the browser is closed".
    # @default 2000000
    cookie_lifetime: 2000000
    #
    # Drupal automatically generates a unique session cookie name based on the
    # full domain name used to access the site. This mechanism is sufficent for
    # most use-cases, including multi-site deployments. However, if it is
    # desired that a session can be reused accross different subdomains, the
    # cookie domain needs to be set to the shared base domain. Doing so assures
    # that users remain logged in as they cross between various subdomains.
    # To maximize compatibility and normalize the behavior across user agents,
    # the cookie domain should start with a dot.
    #
    # @default none

    # Twig debugging:
    #
    # When debugging is enabled:
    # - The markup of each Twig template is surrounded by HTML comments that
    #   contain theming information, such as template file name suggestions.
    # - Note that this debugging markup will cause automated tests that directly
    #   check rendered HTML to fail. When running automated tests, 'debug'
    #   should be set to FALSE.
    # - The dump() function can be used in Twig templates to output information
    #   about template variables.
    # - Twig templates are automatically recompiled whenever the source code
    #   changes (see auto_reload below).
    #
    # For more information about debugging Twig templates, see
    # https://www.drupal.org/node/1906392.

    #
    # By default, Twig templates will be compiled and stored in the filesystem
